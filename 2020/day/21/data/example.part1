The first step is to determine which ingredients can't possibly contain any of
the allergens in any food in your list. In the above example, none of the
ingredients kfcds, nhms, sbzzf, or trh can contain an allergen. Counting the
number of times any of these ingredients appear in any ingredients list
produces 5: they all appear once each except sbzzf, which appears twice.
